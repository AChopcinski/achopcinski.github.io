                        Here's the zones where I see each bowling ball I have in rotation for leagues/touranments currently, assuming a typical house shot. The zones are where I feel comfortable and knowing they can strike semi-consistently from. They can strike from anywhere obviously but where they are most likely to for me.

                <h3>Theorem and Optimum Idol</h3>
                <p>
                    These are both even better on sport conditions! The Idol is the first ball I use everywhere. It's strong, very strong, and I have no issue playing 21-12 with it, however I find it starts to really work well 24-12 out to like 45-24. The Theorem needs to hit dry to be amazing, and I am super thankful for the recommendation on this one. It can carry when missing left but more often than not I'll leave a 2 pin. These work well off of each other for me.

        <h3>TroubleMaker Pearl and Brutal Collision</h3>
        <p>
            I like both of these, but I don't use them often. The Brutal Collision and Idol are fairly close for me so it's a matter of preference and I bring the Idol everywhere since it has a wider area to play with. The Troublemaker is good, it's not a bad ball, it's just, I dunno, the colours? The misfortune of using it during a rough patch with repeating shots? I'm going to give it another shot this season as in practice recently, the way it read the lane reminded me of the phaze 5 which I very much liked. Both of these kind of overlap with the Theorem/Idol, sorta. More often the Theorem will be just the better option than Troublemaker, like Idol the better option more often than Brutal.

                <h3>The Beast Hybrid and Nu Blue Hammer</h3>
                <p>
                    The Beast Hybrid I can use way outside for a few frames, and then way inside at the end of the night, very rarely in between. The Nu Blue is comfortable in a small urethane-like zone for me. It gets squirrelly going too much further left without surface. Using it at 500 mmoves the left boundary of the zone 5 and 5 left.

            <h3>Purple Hammer and Motiv Tank</h3>
            <p>
               More of an FYI here: On cheetah, this is about how each ball was playing. While I know the purple was reading roughly the same spot as the Tank, 5 feet in front of the foul line, it was holding it's line considerably longer before really flipping.

        <p>
            I'd like to play a more 'normal' area of the lanes for league. Don't get me wrong, I really like the Idol and Theorem, but I would not mind having something less, so I don't encounter the ball return as often as I need to move left. I see a gap between the Situational and the others. I'd put the Venom Shock into situational now as well, it's basically the beast, at least my probable dead one is. May be asking for a lot here, but I'm open to suggestions for this, and brand doesn't matter. The Hustles, Scorpions, Envy Tour, Black Venom, Ion? There may be many options or only a few, but a big deciding factor will be shelf appeal, I mean, I have to look at the ball right? Leaning towards the Black Venom/Ion at the moment, not sure what's getting announced outside of the brunswick things (maybe Vaporize?) otherwise but those are the contenders IF i were to add to tbe bag.
